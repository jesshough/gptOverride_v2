# Progress, Ideas, & Questions - Documentation Space
### Progress Reports:
**Week of April 8th:**
- Install Python and any necessary dependencies.
- Set up IDE (Visual Studio Code) and Jupyter Notebook extension.
- Created a new GitHub account and wrote a Profile README
- Configure the version control system (Git) and connect it to my GitHub repository.

**April 17th - 18th:**
- Created a repo for this project.
- Created & filled out a main README for project overview and goals.
- Created a folder containing READMEs for Documentation & FAQ, Installation & Setup, and Usage & Testing (to be filled out as I go).

### Notes & Links:
- From Google:
  - "Cypher is Neo4j's graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph. It is like SQL for graphs, and was inspired by SQL so it lets you focus on what data you want out of the graph (not how to go get it)." _So basically you tell it: "Here's the data I want, go look for it" (Cypher) instead of "go get me the data that's in this location" (SQL)?_

  - This explanation confirms I'll want to use OpenAI's Chat Completion API (also mentioned in the Medium link) if I can!

### Questions:

1. Is a project like this applicable to solving problems like hallucinations?
  - Yes



--------------------
### This is what I had for project goals before clarifying project specs. Keeping for reference:
- Develop an ML model that analyzes GPT's responses and provides _(or suggests?)_ overrides when necessary.
- Incorporate contextual understanding and field-specific knowledge to enhance GPT's NL processing abilities.
- Design a user-friendly (interface or integration method) to incorporate within GPT's response system. _(can I call GPT from my own code/website (localhost?)? What options do I have for this?)_
- Validate the effectiveness of the override system through testing.
