Process, Progress, & Thoughts - Documentation Space
------------
**Week of April 8th:**
- Install Python and any necessary dependencies.
- Set up IDE (Visual Studio Code) and Jupyter Notebook extension.
- Created a new GitHub account and wrote a Profile README
- Configure the version control system (Git) and connect it to my GitHub repository.

**April 17th - 18th:**
- Created a repo for this project.
- Created & filled out a main README for project overview and goals.
- Created a folder containing READMEs for Documentation & FAQ, Installation & Setup, and Usage & Testing (to be filled out as I go).




**Learning / Relevant:**
- From Google:
  - "Cypher is Neo4j's graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph. It is like SQL for graphs, and was inspired by SQL so it lets you focus on what data you want out of the graph (not how to go get it)." _So basically you tell it: "Here's the data I want, go look for it" (Cypher) instead of "go get me the data that's in this location" (SQL)?_

**Questions:**
- Is a project like this applicable to solving problems like hallucinations?
- Once I get the project to a place where I can see if it is choosing the context correctly or not, is the next step to improve the model or the dataset? And if it's just to improve the model, would any improved model only work on the exact dataset that I trained it on? Or would that model be usable on other datasets? _I assume the answers to these questions get into the purpose of AI models and the tasks of people working in AI in general, but I want to make sure I have a good understanding of this._
